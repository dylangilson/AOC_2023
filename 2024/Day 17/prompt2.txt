--- Part Two ---

Digging deeper in the device's manual, you discover the problem: this program is supposed to output another copy of the program!
Unfortunately, the value in register A seems to have been corrupted.
You'll need to find a new value to which you can initialize register A so that the program's output instructions produce an exact copy of the program itself.

For example:

Register A: 2024
Register B: 0
Register C: 0

Program: 0,3,5,4,3,0

This program outputs a copy of itself if register A is instead initialized to 117440. (The original initial value of register A, 2024, is ignored.)

What is the lowest positive initial value for register A that causes the program to output a copy of itself?
